    I've developed several APIs and services in these languages. I also enjoy working with databases like MongoDB and PostgreSQL.
    Here is my <a href="https://github.com/Hoinkyoma37" target="_blank">Github</a>!`,
  "cs-degree": `This is my Computer Science degree. I hung it on the wall because I'm proud of it. It was a very theoretical degree, but I think it gave me a good foundation.`,
  "sofa-table": `That's my sofa. I like to relax here and watch series on Netflix.
  I also make backend programming tutorials on YouTube. Subscribe to <a href="https://youtube.com/@aldahirdev" target="_blank">my channel</a>! (If you like the content)
  You'll learn how I built this portfolio you're currently viewing!`,

  projects: `Info about this portfolio: It's made with Node.js and Express, which are technologies for backend development in JavaScript.
  Text is rendered with HTML/CSS. So the textbox you're currently reading is not rendered within canvas. Learn more about how to use
  these technologies by watching some of my tutorials <a href="https://youtube.com/@aldahirdev" target="_blank">here</a>.`,
  library: `There are a lot of programming books on my shelves. There is even one in French (I also speak French, by the way).
  I probably only read one of them. Who else compulsively buys technical books without ever finishing them?`,
